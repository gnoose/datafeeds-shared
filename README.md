## Testing a scraper locally

Download the latest Chrome driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, and put it in your path.

Running a scraper locally uses data from the `gridium_test` database, managed by
[webapps](https://github.com/gridium/webapps). From webapps, start the database, wait a few minutes for it to start up, then run the unittests to apply any migrations to the `gridium_test` database:

```
docker-compose up -d
python -m unittest -v
```

Set `AES_KEY` in your shell to the value from webapps/localconfig.py. This is needed to decrypt credentials in the database.

Get credentials from a production account into your database. From ops,

```
cd ~/projects/webapps
source venv/bin/activate
cd scripts
python credentials.py meterId scraperName
```

This will print a command that you should run locally to create the data source:

```
python create_test_data_source.py 1 engie username password --said 123 --utility_account_id 456
```

On your local machine, run this from webapps/scripts. This will create a `snapmeter_meter_data_source` record for meter 1 and print the oid of the new record: `create meter data source 5866`. Run the scraper from datafeeds with this oid:

```
python launch.py by-oid 123 2020-08-01 2020-08-05
```
