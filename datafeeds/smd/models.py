""" models.py

This is a lightly-revised copy of webapps ORM for managing provisioning records.

Datafeeds needs access to this ORM so that it can look up how to process a particular workflow and anotate
the outcome of the scraper run. In general, the ORM should not be used to construct new records (other than
provisioning events) since webapps handles this.

#
# The State enumeration tracks where we are in the process of provisioning with one credential.
#
# Failed:
#   The provisioning processor should not try to do anything more with this task. Human intervention is needed.
#
# Begin:
#   This is the default state for a newly created workflow. Nothing has happened yet.
#
# Authorized:
#   We attempted to log into pge.com and authorize the SAIDs available with these credentials. No error flag
#   indicates the authorization succeeded.
#
# Verified:
#   In this step we log back into the SMD authorization site, determine if the utility has finished processing
#   the authorization, and obtain the retail customer identifier if the authorization is complete.
#
# Data Staged:
#   Now that we know what SAIDs to look for, we looked in staging for the relevant meters.
#   If we see the relevant staging objects, we can proceed.
#
# Objects Created:
#   This state records that generated meters, buildings, utility services, and product enrollments from the objects
#   we found in staging.
#
# Data Imported:
#   In this step, we triggered a job in tasks to migrate staging data into our system.
#
# Analytics Ran:
#   In this step, we triggered analytics for newly created meters.
#
# Complete:
#   The provisioning process is over. The processor doesn't need to do any more work.
#
# Refresh Requested:
#   A user has requested that we refresh the authorization (de-authorize and re-authorize) in order to capture
#   new accounts/services that PG&E may have added.
#
# Data Sources Revised:
#   We successfully removed the Meter Data Source and Account Data Source records that will be rendered useless
#   once we de-authorize. Cancel the SMD subscription via API call.
#
# Deprovisioning Requested:
#   A user has requested that we delete this workflow, and the account associated with it.
#
# Account Deactivated:
#   This indicates that we have moved the snapmeter account from the domain ce-portal to ce-deprovisioned,
#   disabled all of the product enrollments for the account, and cancelled all data sources and subscriptions for SMD
#   meters in the workflow.
#
# Deprovisioning Complete:
#   At this point, the account should no longer be visible in the CE portal, and its meters should not show up
#   in CE-related reports (bill audit, rate analysis, etc.).
#
# Note: We may move from the authorization removed state back to the authorized state
# (and cycle through the states after that) in order to provision newly discovered meters (i.e. the directed graph
# of state transitions has a loop in it).
