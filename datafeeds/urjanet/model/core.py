"""Core Urjanet data model

The classes defined in this module represent a projection of the
(relational) Urjanet data model into (non-relational) python
objects. A subset of fields are taken from each Urjanet entity
(Account, Meter, Charge, and Usage), and foreign-key relationships are
expressed as collections.

Generally speaking, field names correspond to the names of columns in
the Urjanet MySQL schema, including the Pascal casing
(e.g. "UsageActualName"), Collection fields are all lower-case
(e.g. "meters", "charges")

Additionally, this module contains a handful of classes for
representing the products of Urjanet data transformation, principally
the transformation from raw Urjanet entities to billing periods.

The primary goal of this data model is to define intermediate objects
to faciliate the transformation of Urjanet data to other formats
(e.g. Gridium billing periods).

Currently, the jsonobject library is used to define these types
(https://github.com/dimagi/jsonobject). This is a lightweight
"ORM-like" system, where, conceptually, the backing store is a json
document. The primary justification for this is testing: one can
express a complex test case as a json document, and easily
deserialized it into this data model.
