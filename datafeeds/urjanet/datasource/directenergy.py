    """A simple Urjanet scraper that collects data for DirectEnergy meters

    Note that DirectEnergy is not a utility, but a retailer. But Urjanet
    displays them as a utility.

    WARNING: The scraper currently makes a variety of assumptions that
    likely limits its general applicability. It currently supports a
    handful of Shorenstien meters, and will need considerable work if
    it is to be used in a broader context.  Assumptions include:

    1) Each statement must contain data for a single POD id.

    2) The date interval on each statement accurately represents the
    billing period for the associated meter/POD id.

    3) The roll-up charge presented by Urjanet for each statement is
    an accurate portrayal of the billing period.

    I bring up (3) because other Urja scrapers compute the bill total
    by summing line items, as happens in other Urjanet scrapers
    (esp. the PGE scraper). Instead we simply use the roll-up from
    Urjanet (specifically, the "NewCharges" attribute of a statement).
